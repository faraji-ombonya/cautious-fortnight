# Heart Disease Prediction System (Back-end)

A heart disease prediction backend that loads a [trained classification model](https://github.com/faraji-ombonya/solid-adventure). 
It then uses the model to serve requests from the [front-end application](https://github.com/faraji-ombonya/stunning-guide).

## Languages and Frameworks

- **Python:** Used for building the Django API.
- **Django:** The framework for developing web applications and APIs.
- **Django Rest Framework:** Utilized for creating RESTful APIs.

## Skills

- **Machine Learning**: Leveraged to provide accurate predictions based on the model from Tier 1.
- **RESTful APIs**: Developed to ensure smooth communication between the model and the user interface.
